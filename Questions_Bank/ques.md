We'll start off sorta easy.

Given 2 pre-sorted lists, write a function that merges both lists and keeps this new lis sorted.

E.g. Given [1,3,5,7,9] and [2,4,6,8,10], your function should return [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10].

Ever had an English composition professor who actually counted the words in your term papers to make sure that you did
not exceed the limit? After you get an “F” on a 5001 word paper because it was supposed to be a 5000 word paper, a few
things come to your mind: What sort of pathetic life does this person lead that causes them to COUNT 5001 WORDS??
How can I keep this from happening again?
Write a program that processes a text file and calculates the number of words it contains. A word is simply a sequence of
non-blank, non-punctuation characters.

Your program should take its input from the text file words.dat This file contains arbitrary text delimited by the
punctuation marks:
. , ; : ! ?
In addition to punctuation marks, text is also delimited by blank spaces.
