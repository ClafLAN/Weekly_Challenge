(WEEKLY CHALLENGE!!

Q: Long before the introduction of modern computers, Ethiopian mathematicians invented an algorithm to easily multiply two numbers, referred to as duplation and mediation or binary multiplication, to assist them to count numbers and trade. They only had to add, double and half pebble into small holes.
Below is the method for the algorithm: 
1. Take two numbers to be multiplied and write them down at the top of two columns.
2. In the left-hand column repeatedly halve the last number, discarding any remainders, and write the result below the last in the same column, until you write a value of 1.
3. In the right-hand column repeatedly double the last number and write the result below. Stop when you add a result in the same row as where the left hand column shows 1.
4. Examine the table produced and discard any row where the value in the left column is even.
5. Sum the values in the right-hand column that remain to produce the result of multiplying the original two numbers together

-o- Implement this algorithm in a programming language of your choice. The program should read two numbers from the user and display their product.
